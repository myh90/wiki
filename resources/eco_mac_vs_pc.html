<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ubu</div><div class="date">11-11-2011, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(English version of article that appeared in L'Espresso, 30 Sept. 1994)<br>
<br>
 Friends, Italians, countrymen, I ask that a Committee for Public Health
 be set up, whose task would be to censor (by violent means, if 
necessary) discussion of the following topics in the Italian press. Each
 censored topic is followed by an alternative in brackets which is just 
as futile, but rich with the potential for polemic. Whether Joyce is 
boring (whether reading Thomas Mann gives one erections). Whether 
Heidegger is responsible for the crisis of the Left (whether Ariosto 
provoked the revocation of the Edict of Nantes). Whether semiotics has 
blurred the difference between Walt Disney and Dante (whether De 
Agostini does the right thing in putting Vimercate and the Sahara in the
 same atlas). Whether Italy boycotted quantum physics (whether France 
plots against the subjunctive). Whether new technologies kill books and 
cinemas (whether zeppelins made bicycles redundant). Whether computers 
kill inspiration (whether fountain pens are Protestant).<br>
<br>
One can continue with: whether Moses was anti-semitic; whether Leon Bloy
 liked Calasso; whether Rousseau was responsible for the atomic bomb; 
whether Homer approved of investments in Treasury stocks; whether the 
Sacred Heart is monarchist or republican.<br>
<br>
I asked above whether fountain pens were Protestant. Insufficient 
consideration has been given to the new underground religious war which 
is modifying the modern world. It's an old idea of mine, but I find that
 whenever I tell people about it they immediately agree with me.<br>
<br>
The fact is that the world is divided between users of the Macintosh 
computer and users of MS-DOS compatible computers. I am firmly of the 
opinion that the Macintosh is Catholic and that DOS is Protestant. 
Indeed, the Macintosh is counter-reformist and has been influenced by 
the ratio studiorum of the Jesuits. It is cheerful, friendly, 
conciliatory; it tells the faithful how they must proceed step by step 
to reach -- if not the kingdom of Heaven -- the moment in which their 
document is printed. It is catechistic: The essence of revelation is 
dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icons. Everyone has a right
 to salvation.<br>
<br>
DOS is Protestant, or even Calvinistic. It allows free interpretation of
 scripture, demands difficult personal decisions, imposes a subtle 
hermeneutics upon the user, and takes for granted the idea that not all 
can achieve salvation. To make the system work you need to interpret the
 program yourself: Far away from the baroque community of revelers, the 
user is closed within the loneliness of his own inner torment.<br>
<br>
You may object that, with the passage to Windows, the DOS universe has 
come to resemble more closely the counter-reformist tolerance of the 
Macintosh. It's true: Windows represents an Anglican-style schism, big 
ceremonies in the cathedral, but there is always the possibility of a 
return to DOS to change things in accordance with bizarre decisions: 
When it comes down to it, you can decide to ordain women and gays if you
 want to.<br>
<br>
Naturally, the Catholicism and Protestantism of the two systems have 
nothing to do with the cultural and religious positions of their users. 
One may wonder whether, as time goes by, the use of one system rather 
than another leads to profound inner changes. Can you use DOS and be a 
Vande supporter? And more: Would Celine have written using Word, 
WordPerfect, or Wordstar? Would Descartes have programmed in Pascal?<br>
<br>
And machine code, which lies beneath and decides the destiny of both 
systems (or environments, if you prefer)? Ah, that belongs to the Old 
Testament, and is talmudic and cabalistic. The Jewish lobby, as 
always.....</div></div><hr>

<br>
In Eco’s newest novel, The Prague Cemetery, to be published in the U.S. 
on Nov. 8, there’s more of the same. But here, there’s a twist: Every 
character except the main villain is an actual historical figure; that 
villain, a fictional forger and all-around creep, invents the Protocols 
of the Elders of Zion as part of the various political and financial 
intrigues roiling late-19th century Europe. <br>

 Unix religion <br>
Macintosh is Catholicism and DOS is Protestant?<br>
<br>
No, no, that's not it at all.<br>
<br>
The OS counterpart to Catholicism is Unix*. Here's why:<br>
Any time you want to do something really important, like a baptism or a system upgrade, you have to call in an expert.<br>
...and even he's going to have to look things up in a book.<br>
When it's all over, if it worked, there must have been an act of God.<br>
*Unix is an esoteric, text-based operating system, harder to use than 
Windows. Now that's an understatement. OK, I like it, but it ain't easy.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Yes, you could say that. I find the whole High Church/Low Church 
distinction to be very hazy because I've found you can have Anglican 
people or parishes with a worldview much closer to their RC neighbours 
and yet they're not big fans of the lace and incense stuff and, on the 
other hand, you can have someone who loves all the St. Swithinmass Day 
stuff yet also has a very Methodist view of the world otherwise. 
Basically the High Church scene can attract not very likeable snobs who 
enjoy a good show in the fashionable parish. On the other hand you still
 have the bearded "cool" clergy. The whole thing's a mess to be honest.</div></div><hr>

That's true.</div></div><hr>

 Science is peculiarly rich in this sort of doctrinal schism; Ethernet

broadband, TCP and ISO, SNA and everything else - all dichotomies which 
come immediately to mind, and all of which once excited their respective

An interesting field of enquiry.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Yes and the pedigree of programming languages can be as hard to follow 
as that of a church after numerous schisms: Actionscript is a type of 
Ecmascript which is the current name for Javascript which, despite its 
name, is not related to Java ....<br>
<br>
Also the difference between high level or low level programming is 
similar to the difference between religion as seen by theologians and 
religion as seen by the parishioner.</div></div><hr>
