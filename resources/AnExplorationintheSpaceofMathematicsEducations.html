Intentions</b></font></div>

<p>A mathematical metaphor frames the intentions of this paper. Imagine 
that we know how to construct an N-dimensional space, ME, in which each 
point represents an alternative mathematics education -- or ame -- and 
each dimension a feature such as a component of content, a pedagogical 
method, a theoretical or ideological position. Each "reform" of 
mathematics education introduces new points and each fundamental idea a 
new dimension. Thus, if one considers a particular point (an ame) in ME,
 among its many "coordinates" are a (metaphorical) measure that runs 
from informal to formal and another that runs from instructionist to 
constructivist. In the paper I shall define seven more such oppositional
 principles that have not been recognized in the past as structuring 
choices in mathematics education.

</p><p>Within ME I distinguish two subsets. SME (S for school) is the 
set of mathematics educations to be found on any significant scale in 
schools; DME (D for defensible) is the set of ames that could be 
defended as serving the social and mathematical purposes that justify 
the expense and effort of education in mathematics.

</p><p>Although a hard-nosed practical educator might frown on spending 
time and money designing an ame with any intention other than 
implementation, the exploration of ME has a theoretical interest that 
transcends immediate applicability of any individual ame. The most 
down-to-earth intention of this paper is to convey a sense of a 
particular ame, called <i>z</i>, which is presented here not as a 
proposal for school reform but rather as an exercise in "pure" research 
in mathematics education. A thought experiment. With ten more in the 
same spirit we would begin to have an idea of the space we inhabit as 
theorists of mathematics education.

</p><p>One could conceptuali<i>z</i>e the exercise of constructing ames 
as giving serious technical content to the discussion (usually conducted
 during cocktail hour) of the limits of what counts as mathematics 
education. For example one might wonder whether there exists an ame in 
DME whose set of topics is disjoint from school mathematics: no number 
crunching skills, no algebra (at least in the school sense of that word)
 and no Euclid. Most mathematics educators, in fact most people, would 
be skeptical. But how can anyone really know without investing the time,
 effort and mathematical creativity needed to carry the construction of 
hypothetical ames far enough to serve as counter-examples to the 
conservative negative answer or as existence proofs for a positive 
answer? Indeed, how could a discourse emerge for talking and thinking 
about the real potential directions of development of mathematics 
education except through the exercise of serious discussion of a diverse
 range of hypothetical directions?
</p><p>The exploration of ME might confirm or refute what are for me two
 compelling theoretical intuitions. The first of these is a tantalizing 
sense of past thinking about mathematics education as being confined to a
 tiny subset of ME, thus creating for a next generation the exciting 
prospect of breaking into new worlds. The second is more fundamental and
 more relevant to immediate concerns of researchers: Small or big, SME's
 shape must be as obscure for us as a pentagram is for flatlanders 
unless we learn to situate it in its containing space. A step in this 
direction is identifying my seven new axes (or dimensions) of variation 
in mathematics education analogous to the formal-informal and 
instructionist-constructivist dimensions. Since these are the axes along
 which <i>z</i> is most clearly separated from SME, recogni<i>z</i>ing 
them gives structure to <i>z</i>'s placement in ME.

</p><p>I have worked on and off for over thirty years on the 
construction of <i>z</i>. Some products of this activity have spun off 
and been assimilated (sometimes with positive and sometimes with 
negative valence) by the culture of school mathematics: notably the 
concept of <i>turtle</i> as a basis for a topic in elementary geometry, 
the concept of <i>microworld</i> as the context for project-oriented 
work and the concept of <i>Logo</i> as a programming language designed 
for learning. This assimilation could hardly happen without denaturing 
ideas developed in a perspective of more radical change to which this 
paper returns them. Public discussion of the original enterprise feels 
more timely and more realistic today because the accumulation of 
relevant ideas and experience has (though just barely) reached a needed 
critical mass; because <i>z</i>'s intensive use of technology is 
beginning to lose the aura of science fiction that impeded serious 
consideration at earlier times; and because a growing, even if still 
inchoate movement for radical educational change, is beginning to come 
out of the closet.

</p><p>The presentation of <i>z</i> and the formulation of the 
oppositional principles will contribute to some currently active issues 
in the literature. In particular: (i) I see a theme of my work that I 
refer to here as "the principle of thingness" as an earthier cousin of 
the concept of <i>reification</i> which has become very lively in the 
past few years (Confrey, in press; Dubinsky, 1992; G. Harel, 1992; 
Sfard, 1992, 1994); (ii) a discussion of work on probabilistic thinking 
stands in here for a generally jaundiced view of what mathematics 
educators can learn from the experimental cognitive studies paradigm 
(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1982; Shaughnessy, 1992; Wilensky, 1993, 1995);
 (iii) the paper as a whole is intended to broaden discussion of the 
role of computers in the evolution of mathematics education by 
suggesting a more transformative impact on changes in content then is 
suggested even in the most forward-looking publications in the 
mathematics education literature (diSessa et al., 1966; Kaput, 1992; 
Noss &amp; Hoyles, 1996).

</p><p>The design of <i>z</i> is guided by (i) wanting it to be as <i>different</i>
 as possible from SME in identifiable, theoretically interesting ways 
(so that far reaches of ME can be probed); and (ii) wanting it to use 
ideas that can be seen as extrapolations from actual experiences of real
 people working at mathematics in forms at least piece-wise similar to <i>z</i>
 (so that we can appeal to intuition to inform judgment about <i>z</i>'s
 plausibility and mathematical quality).

</p><p>In the rest of the paper I present a series of spots intended to 
show aspects of the kind of thinking that informs <i>z</i> applied to 
levels ranging from pre-school children to mathematically educated 
adults.


</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><p></p><div align="center"><font face="" size="+1"><b>1. A First 
Peep at <i>z</i></b></font></div>

<p>I start with a corner of <i>z</i> that is likely to have immediate 
name recognition as an idea that's in the air: bringing probability into
 elementary mathematics. We peep (in an imaginary but only slight 
extrapolation from real conditions) at children as young as five or six 
using an iconic form of MicroWorlds Logo to create animations and simple
 green games. Specifically we observe one child leaning over to ask 
another, "How did you make your colors do <i>THAT</i>?" and being shown a
 screen object whose name is RANDOM and whose simplest behaviors can be 
grasped in minutes.

</p><p>The first of my oppositional principles is brought out by 
contrasting the activity of these children with a more common way to 
introduce probability in schools by using physical materials such as 
spinners or dice to introduce children to the idea of probability. I 
ask: what can these children do with this new knowledge besides talk or 
deal with teacher-initiated problems? How can a child actually use it to
 do something that has real personal importance <i>now</i>? My Logo kids
 are excited because they can produce dramatic screen effects and will 
go on using their growing control over random processes in projects of 
increasing complexity. What can your spinner spinners do that will give 
them a sense of empowerment and achievement?

</p><p>The principle is called the power principle or "what comes first,
 using it or 'getting it'?" The natural mode of acquiring most knowledge
 is through use leading to progressively deepening understanding. Only 
in school, and especially in SME is this order systematically inverted. 
The power principle re-inverts the inversion.

</p><p>As part of a study of the perception of the principle in 
education circles, I asked a group of teachers to rate the relationship 
between a spinner and RANDOM on a scale from "no relation" to "no 
difference." I was surprised to find that the high school math teachers 
in my admittedly too small sample of six saw less difference and made 
more comments like "both illustrate the concept of probability" than the
 (non-specialist) elementary school teachers who saw more difference and
 were more prone to make comments like "you can do more with RANDOM." It
 seems likely that these answers reflect a difference between the 
culture of elementary and high schools. In the former, project-oriented 
work may not be dominant, but it is sufficiently present to make 
teachers think about new ideas as a source of power to do something. In 
the latter, the emphasis is not on <i>using</i> ideas but on <i>understanding</i>
 them. The spirit of <i>z</i> is more akin to that of the elementary 
school, though it goes very much further in using the power principle as
 a criterion for what is taught as well as how it is learned.

</p><p>The use of the power principle in <i>z</i> is closely related to 
two other inversions: project/problem and media/content. The girl who 
asked her friend about her color effects certainly had a problem and 
found a solution. But had you asked her what she was doing she would not
 have said "problem solving." She may have said "working on my flowers 
project" and she would have gotten the order right: projects are 
primary, problems come up in the course of projects and are sometimes 
"solved" and sometimes "dissolved." It is an inversion order to define 
the goal of mathematics as problem-solving (though this is better than 
defining it as rote learning of multiplication tables), and the design 
of <i>z</i> inverts this inversion too in the form of the principle 
"project before problem." Undoubtedly some people like doing problems 
that are not parts of projects and this is their right. I imagine I 
would be counted as one of them, although I suspect that my joy in 
solving apparently dissociated problems is part of a larger project I 
don't know how to name. But in any case the solving of an isolated 
problem just because someone asked you might be fun but it is not what 
mathematics -- or life -- is about.

</p><p>The power principle can be carried far because <i>z</i> assumes 
excellent material and cultural conditions for working on mathematically
 rich projects and this in turn rests on another shift. The typical 
activity in contemporary school is making inscriptions on paper. The 
typical activity of <i>z</i> is manipulating a computer-based 
microworld. Of course it is not to be assumed that the shift of media 
has radical consequences in itself. As long as it is assumed that 
content primes over media, the new media will be used to support the old
 content and will often do this badly since the content was defined for 
the old media. The relevant inversion that informs the design of <i>z</i>
 leads to assuming that new media open the door to new contents.

</p><p></p><div align="center"><font face="" size="+1"><b>2. 
Re-empowering Probability: A Sketch of the Stochastic Presence in <i>z</i></b></font></div>

<p>The little peep at children using RANDOM in their projects showed the
 presence of a stochastic idea but did not show anything resembling the 
ideas that would normally be included in a school course on probability.
 This is the result of a deliberate judgment that the best use of the 
new media would be achieved by taking <i>random variable</i> rather than
 <i>probability</i> as the introductory concept for a strand of <i>z</i>
 that should then be called something more general than "Probability," 
such as "probabilistic thinking" (abbreviated here as PT) or 
"stochastics."

</p><p>This might seem perverse since the idea of random variable would 
generally be regarded as mathematically more sophisticated than 
probability, which can, after all, be introduced using mathematics as 
simple as fractions. One might fear that in the end the use of RANDOM 
would turn out to be pragmatically powerful but mathematically weak. Had
 this been the case I would have turned it over to teachers of art or 
biology and not been writing about it here. However it is not the case. 
RANDOM can be presented in a way that is powerful not only for the 
applied results it achieves but also for the richness of its connections
 with mathematical ideas.

</p><p>When I was comparing RANDOM with the spinner I focused on its 
greater pragmatic power. Later in this section we'll see even more 
compelling examples to show how <i>z</i> can give children at ages like 6
 or 8 or 10 a sense of the power of probabilistic thinking that far 
surpasses what graduate students in education schools routinely get from
 their courses on probability and statistics. This is what qualifies it 
as empowering. The use of <i>Re-empowering</i> in the heading of this 
section reflects a hope of reversing a historical process through which 
one of the most powerful ideas in our intellectual heritage is (not 
untypically) disempowered in its school presentation, where it is 
reduced to shallow manipulations that seldom connect to anything the 
student experiences as important.

</p><p>The degree to which RANDOM has greater pragmatic power than the 
spinner is impressive. But as a mathematician I see another difference 
as more fundamental and another limitation in the thinking of the math 
teachers I interviewed as much more saddening. In their ratings of 
degrees of difference, none of them referred at all to the idea that the
 spinner is a physical object while RANDOM is a mathematical object. 
Indeed in conversation it was clear that the idea of a mathematical 
object was very far from the center of their intellectual radar screens.

</p><p>I shall go from here in two directions, taking the simpler first 
and the more subtle later, even though it is more fundamental.

</p><p>(i) Let's note that RANDOM is sufficiently like a function<sup>1</sup>
 to be experienced by young students as such if the core of being a 
function is taken not as some abstract definition but as how functions 
are used, how they combine, what purpose they serve. RANDOM is used in 
functional compositions even at the most elementary level in 
instructions like

</p><p>SETCOLOR RANDOM [blue green]<sup>2</sup> 

</p><p>I have seen children just a few years older using RANDOM in an 
explicitly functional form in instructions like the following two ways 
to generate random "century numbers" up to a million:

</p><p>100*(RANDOM 10,000)<br>
</p><p>WORD (RANDOM 10,000) "00<sup>3</sup>

</p><p>These nine- or ten-year-old children are very comfortable with 
making a new function they might call, say, RANDOM-CENTURY using Logo 
methods of procedural definition. This goes way beyond any traditional 
transaction between mid-elementary school students and functions and is 
presumably far short of what the <i>z</i> students would do with their 
greater opportunities to develop computer fluency.

</p><p>(ii) In (i) we saw RANDOM as a carrier of the idea of function. 
It can be a carrier for many other mathematical ideas and perhaps most 
importantly for the idea of a mathematical object. As I develop a first 
insight into this I shall be showing how to follow yet another of the 
seven principles, the <i>thingness principle</i>: object before 
operation.

</p><p>Let me stand back and show how I see this principle applying at 
even earlier ages, even before the child feels comfortable with typing 
and reading. It is common today to use computer interfaces that replace 
typing instructions by combinations of pointing, clicking, dragging, 
pull-down menus and so on and so forth. I think this is overdone and 
often done badly<sup>4</sup>. A significant step toward a good use is 
shown by MicroChild, a version of MicroWorlds Logo made by A. Sopranov<sup>5</sup>
 in which Logo-like instructions and even procedures are constructed by 
putting "blocks" together, like making a Lego house. In this context, 
with a little more development, ideas of function, composition of 
functions, definition of functions, transformation of functions can 
become perfectly natural to preschool children. More important, they 
would be accustomed to thinking of functions (and of course many other 
mathematical entities) as thing-like: you put them somewhere, you move 
them from one place to another, you build with them, you give them names
 . . . all this I see as making "thingness" operational by giving 
entities thing-like properties and by relating to them as things. 

</p><p>What can be done at such early ages can be done at later ages. In
 a while I shall develop an example in which entities like gravity are 
given a thing-like representation not to avoid typing but to help 
thinking. In much the same way that object-oriented programming 
facilitates the development of software, object-oriented theories can 
facilitate the development of theories by a beginner (Papert, 1992).
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>More Powerful Work in PT</i>

</p><p>I have worked even more extensively with children in the 
eight-to-ten age range on another kind of problem where probabilistic 
thinking is experienced as a powerful way to get things done.

</p><p>Consider a hypothetical student who has constructed a simulation 
of tropism by programming a screen creature (called a logomecium) to 
move toward another screen object (the goal). The logomecium is able to 
detect whether the goal is more to the left or to the right and its law 
of motion is to move forward continuously making small adjustments of 
heading in the direction detected. This kind of construction comes up 
naturally in a variety of contexts including biological simulations 
(from which the logomecium gets its name), games (for example when one 
character chases another) and some interesting geometric situations 
(e.g. if the goal follows a path, say a circle, what does the logomecium
 do?).

</p><p>So far no PT, but at least an insight into another strand of <i>z</i>
 I like to call "cybernetics" that includes building physical as well as
 screen-based "creatures." <i>But probabilistic thinking comes into the 
picture when we consider what happens if the logomecium encounters an 
uncrossable (but transparent) obstacle.</i> The solution that is easiest
 to implement and can also lay claim to being conceptually the richest 
consists of introducing a probabilistic element into the behavior of the
 logomecium. The implementation is made especially perspicuous (and 
easy) in MicroWorlds Logo by its capacity for multi-processing. The 
original program can be left intact -- and even running -- while a 
randomizer agent is created as a separate entity for example to make the
 logomecium turn randomly every so often.<sup>6</sup>

</p><p>Students naturally ask: Is this a better behavior? This is a good
 theme for discussion: the randomness makes the logomecium a little less
 efficient if there is no obstacle and much more efficient if there are 
some. Many rich issues, some on the fringes of statistical inference, 
are raised by attempting
an experimental comparison of several logomecia -- with and without the 
randomizer and using different algorithms in the systematic or in the 
random components of behavior. In my experience of similar situations (I
 have not actually worked with this one), the students will begin by 
thinking that the question could be settled by a race, that is to say, 
by one run of a race. However, if the contestant creatures were created 
by members of the group, the losers have a sufficient stake in a 
critical stance for heated discussion, out of which can emerge the idea 
that more that one run is needed to make any inference and that the 
comparison of logomecia cannot be absolute since A can be superior 
(statistically) to B with a certain configuration of obstacles while B 
beats A with another configuration.<sup>7</sup>

</p><p>The logomecium's behavior using the random strategy can 
fruitfully be compared with the computationally more complex behavior of
 recognizing that it is blocked (which it does not have to do for the 
random strategy to work) and finding its way around the obstacle. The 
idea that obstacle avoidance can have probabilistic and/or deterministic
 components leads to looking at real creatures (e.g. paramecia or flies 
or bees) and trying to determine whether there is a probabilistic 
element in their behavior. Whatever the outcome, there is room here for 
discussion about the use of randomness as a powerful problem-solving 
technique. It is not hard to elicit animated discussion about the many 
ways in which "nature" has "used" this technique. A teacher (or a text 
or an advice program) could encourage individual students to undertake 
research projects aimed at searching for situations where randomness is 
useful as well as for situations in which randomness is a nuisance to be
 overcome. In the next section we meet a case of using randomness in a 
mathematical context
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>Monte Carlo</i>

</p><p>A powerful and very general use of random process is seen in the 
"Monte Carlo" method of finding the area of a region by the analog of 
throwing darts and calculating the ratio of hits to misses. The graphs 
in Figure 1 represent on the <i>y</i>-axis the ratio of hits to misses 
for a circle and its inscribed square against the number of throws 
sampled every 50 times for a total of 20,000. They were made in the 
course of exploring questions about how many "darts" to throw and helped
 answer that question, but also gave rise to a series of mathematical 
questions that flourished into a full-fledged mathematical 
investigation.
</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><div align="center"><img alt=""

border="0"></div>
 <div align="center"><i>Figure 1</i></div>

<p>In many similar situations I have had excellent conversations with 
middle school students and some younger ones, based on looking at these 
graphs in more detail than simply noting their convergence to an 
asymptote. Questions that come up often are about why it stays so long 
on one side and indeed about why it converges at all. One group of 
middle school students spontaneously raised the question: "If after 
10,000 shots a freak run took the graph far off, would it come back 
again faster or slower than in the early part?" They thought it would be
 faster. In what I see as a prime example of the value for young 
mathematical investigators of being fluent in Logo, it took less than 30
 minutes to mount an experiment that allowed perturbations to be 
introduced by "forced runs."<sup>8</sup>  Figure 2 shows
what these kids interpreted with amazement as recovery being slower from
 perturbations that come late in the process. But they also found that 
it was "harder" to produce "the same" perturbation. And this led them to
 engage with ideas that eventually led to inventing an informal but 
perspicuous proof of a form of the law of large numbers.

<p>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>The Power of Project Immersion</i>

</p><p>In case the last paragraph seems to be too good to be true, it is
 time for a digression on the beginnings of an accumulation of data that
 show people performing at greatly superior levels when they are 
immersed in projects.

</p><p>A particularly clean example is an apparent paradox in the report
 by Sfard and Leron (in press). They ask which of the following two 
problems is harder:

</p><p>P1: Given three points, (2,3), (-1,4), and (0,-1), in the plane, 
find the center and the radius of the circle through them.<br>
P2: Write a computer program that accepts any three points in the plane 
(given by their coordinates) and returns the center and the radius of 
the circle through them.

</p><p>Since P2 asks for more than P1, one could argue that 
tautologically it must be harder. But Sfard and Leron report that more 
than half of their students failed at P1 and nearly all succeeded at P2.
 Why? It is not any magic of the computer except the fact that working 
at the computer transforms the stance of the students from "solving a 
problem" to "pursuing a project."

</p><p>Something similar happens when a transition is made from 
"thinking about" the graphs in Figure 1 to an engagement with trying to 
transform the process. Uri Wilensky wrote a thesis (for which I had the 
great pleasure to be advisor) based on a brilliant series of case 
studies that show people (in his case adults of very varied degrees of 
sophistication) shifting from the perplexed denseness usually evoked by 
questions about probability to high-quality intellectual engagement when
 the questions became part of a "learner-owned investigation." Another 
of my thesis advisees, Idit Harel, shows how the performance of a 
mathematically poor student is turned around when she becomes deeply 
(and emotionally) involved in a multi-month project of software 
development.

</p><p>Similar observations can be culled from working with students on 
fragments of the PT strand of <i>z</i>. As background to one of these I 
recall one of the many experiments by Kahneman and Tversky that have 
supported a prevailing view that "people" are inherently poor at 
probabilistic reasoning. In the "taxi problem," subjects are asked to 
give their estimate of the probability that the taxicab seen by a 
witness was blue or green given (i) the witness said it was blue (ii) 
independent tests show that the witness makes correct identifications 
80% of the time and (iii) 85% of the cabs are blue. A surprisingly high 
proportion of subjects base their conclusion entirely on (i) and (ii) 
and ignore (iii). The following story offers insight into a kind of 
experience that might foster a better development of probabilistic 
judgment. The story also touches on the strength of making (rather than 
playing) computer games as a context for mathematical learning.

</p><p>I have constructed collaboratively with eight-year-old children 
and successfully played games like the following.<sup>9</sup> There are 
two kinds of screen critters called reddies and greenies. They look 
exactly alike and each kind lays eggs whose color is determined by a 
random variable whose possible values are red and green. But in the two 
cases the random variable has different distributions: for example, 
looking inside the critters at their programs one might see RANDOM [red 
red red green] in a reddy and RANDOM [red green green green] in a 
greeny.

</p><p>A critter appears and begins to lay eggs. The player has to guess
 whether it is a reddy or a greeny. Points are gained for correct 
guesses and lost for incorrect guesses. There is a penalty for taking 
time to make the guess; perhaps points are lost as a function of time or
 perhaps the penalty takes the form of allowing a second player to get 
in first with the guess.

</p><p>Variants of the game have different consequences for making the 
error and for taking time. For example, suppose the player gets a point 
for guessing right and loses one for guessing wrong. In this variant one
 might as well guess immediately. But if the cost of a wrong guess is 
ten points and the cost of delaying the decision not too heavy, it is 
better to observe several eggs before deciding.

</p><p>I certainly saw examples of the Kahneman and Tversky finding. 
However, I also saw another behavior in one child who was eager to set 
the game up in such a way as to "catch" the player. With this different <i>intention</i>,
 the idea of <i>exploiting the taxi problem fallacy</i> presented no 
difficulties whatsoever. Switching from a problem-solving stance to a 
project-construction stance radically transformed the "difficulty" of 
the idea of <i>a priori</i> probability. In terms of idea-power theory, 
the shift could be seen as changing the status of the <i>a priori</i> 
probability from an annoying factor that complicates thinking (and that 
one would just as well forget) to a useful, empowering idea that one can
 use to get a desired result. Otherwise put: appropriating the fallacy 
for personal use led quickly to understanding it.

</p><p>In my view this leads to a radically different interpretation of 
the Kahneman-Tversky findings: people whose relationship with 
probabilistic (or any other) ideas has always been superficial use this 
thinking superficially. Learning probability by throwing dice and 
calculating (ugh!) fractions will reinforce what Kahneman and Tversky 
find. Integrating it as a powerful and empowering idea will give rise to
 something else.
</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><p></p><div align="center"><font face="" size="+1"><b>3. Kinetic 
Microworlds: Dynamics Before Statistics</b></font></div>

<p>The computational context of PT illustrates another of the seven 
principles, which I'll state here as <i>dynamics before statics</i> 
using this formulation to contrast it with the tendency in school to 
place <i>statics before dynamics.</i>

</p><p>I first became convinced of the importance of this issue through 
thinking about the almost universal pattern in school physics of placing
 statics before dynamics. This ordering appears odd, an inversion of the
 natural order, from a number of points of view. I start with the most 
fundamental.<sup>10</sup>

</p><p>Classical physics is most coherently presented as deriving 
logically from a set of propositions aptly called Newton's <i>Laws of 
Motion</i> -- aptly because they are essentially principles of dynamics.
 However, the pedagogical order when elementary physics has any 
theoretical content comes close to a complete inversion of this logical 
order. The reasons for this given to me by a large number of science 
teachers in an informal survey could all be reduced to the idea that 
dynamics actually is conceptually intrinsically harder. Some of the more
 articulate ones amplified this by pointing out that one needs calculus 
to do dynamics seriously and calculus comes at the end of a prerequisite
 chain that runs something like arithmetic to algebra to calculus.

</p><p>Now one can quibble in many ways about the necessity of this 
ordering, but I believe that the fundamental issue is that there is 
truth in it insofar as it reflects the static nature of 
pre-computational media. To state a complex matter far too simply, 
calculus is a way of representing dynamic phenomena in the static medium
 of pencil and paper; it is "hard" because the medium fights the 
message.

</p><p>The theme of this section is to show some of the less obvious 
ways in which new dynamic media, illustrated by a strand of work in <i>z</i>
 which I'll call "dynamic thinking" and abbreviated by DT, allow us to 
invert the inversion.

</p><p>The work with videogames and logomecia contributes to this by 
introducing young students to a mindset for which the phrase "law of 
motion" evokes a warm and natural connotation rather than the fu<i>zz</i>y
 bewilderment that surrounds the idea when the first example encountered
 is Newton's. Surely this is a step toward learning physics as well as 
mathematics. But what comes next?


</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>3a. Object-oriented Study of the Study of Motion</i>

</p><p>A good example is the empowerment of the idea of decomposition of
 motions by starting off with the use of a tool for the construction of 
useful motions. Cast in this form, the idea has a seed no more difficult
 at age six than Etch-a-Sketch. A simple point-and-click tool allows the
 combination of horizontal and vertical motion to produce motion in any 
desired direction. Once this is firmly in place intuitively it is an 
easy step to use a tool that will split velocities into components that 
need not be parallel to the axes.

</p><p>Following the principle of thingness, I believe that the best way
 to do this involves "thingifying" motions (or perhaps velocities). Thus
 if we are making a game and wish to create a character we shall be 
moving in complex ways, it would be a good idea to create an icon for 
the character's motion. We can then <i>name the motion</i>, place it in a
 corner of the screen, move it over to a tool in order to change it, 
split it, combine it with other motions or whatever. In other words it 
can behave like a thing and so should be counted as a thing. I have no 
doubt that thingifying motion makes it easier to work with and 
ultimately to understand.

</p><p>Another powerful example of thingification is seen in the 
following detail. A student is trying to make a videogame in the style 
of Mario Bros. where a character runs across the screen encountering 
various challenges and obstacles. It is natural to want to make the 
character jump, but what is a jump? How does jumping work?

</p><p>The obvious simple way to make a jump is to give it a rectangular
 path. In traditional Logo one might do SETY YCOR + 1 and later SETY 
YCOR -10. But most of the students with whom I have worked are not 
satisfied with this jump. To obtain a more realistic, or at least a more
 interesting, trajectory, several powerful ideas are helpful.

</p><p>The first of these is naming (which really means thingifying) the
 mathematical object we call a trajectory. This is not something one can
 see, and in my experience children do not think of the path as a thing 
with its own identity. The next powerful idea is combining velocities to
 make new velocities. When this is available the character in the game 
might be represented as having not one but two velocities, a hori<i>z</i>ontal
 velocity and a vertical velocity. Suppose at the beginning that both 
are set to <i>z</i>ero speed. One can make the character run by making 
the horizontal speed, say, 20. Now initiating a jump could start by 
making the vertical speed 10. This is a step in the right direction but 
results in the character going off into the sky.

</p><p>I have not yet seen a youngster who does not immediately say 
something like, "We need gravity." The next problem is how to represent 
gravity. Again there are many approaches; I have mostly chosen to point 
students toward what seems to me the most powerful approach: thinking of
 gravity as a thing and representing it as a computational object.

</p><p>Thus gravity comes to be represented by one of the more powerful 
modern computational ideas: <i>an object inherently endowed with the 
capacity to have properties</i>. As a first shot at specifying those 
properties I have found it useful to suggest that "gravity eats vertical
 velocity." Whenever another object has a vertical velocity, Gravity, 
now personalized, detects this and begins to nibble away at it. So our 
figure's vertical velocity will successively be 10, 9, 8 and eventually 0
 and then -1, -2, and this means that it is coming down. But there is 
still a bug. When the character hits the ground it should stop, but on 
the present definition of gravity it will just keep going into the 
ground. We next have to build into the definition of the gravity object a
 clause that turns it into: gravity eats vertical velocity of <i>unsupported</i>
 objects. When I have worked with children they have generally been 
content to use being over the ground's color as the criterion to judge  
"being supported." But in some cases this criterion was seen as 
inadequate. This does not mean it was seen as "wrong" but rather as 
needing more work. So we see an evolutionary process. At each stage 
there is a working system which manner of working is seen as flawed, but
 on examination gives suggestions about how to change it to be closer to
 what is desired.

</p><p>I conclude this section with the observation that this 
representation of gravity as a computational object is so different from
 standard representations that it deserves a name; I think that <i>"object-oriented
 theory"</i> would be appropriate. And so we see, to make a point that 
deserved more discussion than it is getting in this paper, mathematics 
education can draw on computation not only to provide physical 
computers, but to provide a much richer set of new representations of 
knowledge than the idea of "procedural representation" that has slipped 
into cognitive discourse.

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>3b. The Parabola</i>

</p><p>A mathematician should not be satisfied with simply making the 
jump. One would also like to know about the properties of the trajectory
 of the jumper, in particular that it is a parabola. But what does this 
mean?

</p><p>In the narrow school perspective this would mean proving that 
"the equation of the trajectory is y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c." In the 
perspective of designing <i>z</i> I take a different approach by 
questioning the privileged role given by SME to that particular 
"definition" of parabola. I conjecture that this shows the influence of 
an educational technology of pencil and paper that makes plotting curves
 from equations an exercise that is both easy to prescribe and easy to 
grade. In the perspective of the kind of work we have been looking at 
one might instead take as the first formal characterization of a 
parabola the following: the trajectory followed when the <i>x</i> 
velocity and the <i>y</i> acceleration are both constant. Formally this 
is strictly equivalent to SME's and is at least as supportive of 
investigation of properties of parabolas!

</p><p>My point here is not to argue that one characterization of the 
parabola is better than another, but only to give what I see as a good 
example of how the influence of the media used can make one or another 
seem to be the natural one. But whichever is better when one looks at 
the isolated case of the parabola, there is no doubt that in general 
much more can be done at an elementary level with dynamic than with 
algebraic characterizations of curves. Think for example of how easy it 
is to work with spirals in turtle geometry or with computer generation 
of fractals.

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p></p><div align="center"><font face="" size="+1"><b>4. Turtle 
Geometry</b></font></div>

<p>I have refrained from explaining what kind of formalism is used to 
produce and control the various animations and movements used in PT and 
DT because it is orthogonal to my purpose: this could be done in many 
ways to achieve the same effects. However, the best way in my opinion is
 still through the use of turtle geometry, and this is what I would use 
as the foundation for a personal version of <i>z</i>.

</p><p>I assume that the reader is familiar with the turtle concept, but
 a few remarks may be necessary here to ensure that it is understood in 
the same form. (In section 6, below, a more advanced turtle topic than 
usual will be developed).

</p><p>Turtle geometry -- the name and the concept -- has been used in a
 variety of ways. In a form more often called turtle graphics, it is 
frequently used as a programming topic for beginners, mainly but not 
only in Logo. Abelson and diSessa have drawn wide attention to the idea 
of using it as a topic that lends itself to relatively advanced 
mathematical explorations. Noss and Hoyles (1996) have most directly 
recognized the value of turtle geometry as a research tool to study the 
development of mathematical thinking, using it as a "window into the 
mind" (see also the work of Harel, 1991; Lawler, 1981,1985; Resnick, 
1994; Solomon, 1986; Weir, 1986). A number of authors have used it as a 
tool for producing attractive graphics and for gaining insights into 
graphical pattern structures. These studies each exploit a partial 
aspect, but lost the holistic view, of the motivating vision of a 
well-rounded piece of mathematics that would allow simplified entry 
points for very young novices and yet have multiple connections with 
mathematical ideas.

</p><p>Consider for example how the idea of <i>theorem</i> can be 
re-empowered for a student in the context of actually working with 
turtles. In <i>z</i>, as in working with children, I favor introducing 
the word <i>theorem</i> at a very early age usually instantiated first 
by what I call "The Total Turtle Trip Theorem" (TTTT) presented in some 
such form as "If the turtle makes a trip back to its starting state 
without crossing its own path, the total turn is 360 degrees." This 
statement assumes prior definitions of "state" and the total turn (the 
algebraic sum of all its turns), but this is no burden since both of 
these are empowering concepts for someone trying to control turtle 
movements. And both are more generally powerful concepts as measured by 
the ramifications of their connections in mathematics and science.

</p><p>As presented, what makes the TTTT a "theorem" is the possession 
of several attributes: first, it is powerful; second, it is surprising; 
third, it has a proof. And although what we can offer as a proof may not
 reach the standards of a formal logician, it is as sound as the typical
 style of proof of working mathematicians. Similarly, the advice "play 
turtle" given to someone trying to figure out how the turtle should move
 is not only very effective in solving the problem, it is also very 
effective in conveying the idea of "heuristic."

</p><p>A final point I want to make here will be amplified in the next 
two sections. This is the wide range of kinds of mathematical work that 
can be done with the turtle. Consider for example the problem of finding
 a formula for the area of a circle. I did not mention the word 
"turtle," but the Monte Carlo procedure made typical use of turtle 
geometry not only by placing a turtle at a random position and testing 
whether it was in the circle but also for drawing the graph. But if one 
can only understand something one way, one has not understood it at all,
 and so it is relevant that turtle geometry lends itself to other 
interesting ways to look at this problem. For example, even at the most 
elementary level the circumference of the circle is seen as a limit of 
polygons, and so the area is easily represented as a limit of sums of 
triangles.

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p></p><div align="center"><font face="" size="+1"><b>5. Rugby 
Session</b></font></div>

<p>Looking at a problem-solving session of which the participants are 
adult researchers in mathematics education allows me to discuss the 
spirit of <i>z</i> on another level, by comparison with the way in which
 a set of highly competent mathematics educators participated in a real 
mathematical activity.

</p><p>I have selected a problem that has recently been the subject of 
published commentaries by several researchers whose general philosophies
 of education are close enough to my own to engage specific dialogue and
 bring out how <i>z</i> differs from the shared position in the "Logo 
community" (Noss &amp; Hoyles, 1996; Resnick, 1993; Wilensky, this 
issue). All these authors participated in a workshop the members of 
which were invited to use their preferred software tools to tackle the 
following problem (summarized here from Wilensky's description):

</p><p>After a try has been scored [by touching-down at point C], the 
scoring team has the opportunity to gain further points by "kicking a 
conversion" [i.e. kicking the ball into the goal -- the segment AB in 
the figure]. The kick can be taken from anywhere on an imaginary line 
[line CK in the figure] that is perpendicular to the try line [line CB 
in the figure] and goes through the point where the try was scored [C in
 the figure]. Where should the kick be taken from to maximize the chance
 of a score? (In other words, where should we place the point K, so as 
to maximize the angle AKB?) 


</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><div align="center"><img alt="" 
src="AnExplorationintheSpaceofMathematicsEducations_files/figure2a.jpg" 
border="0"></div>

	

<p>Of the three approaches that appear to have been followed at the 
workshop, the first used Cabri, therefore taking the question as a 
problem in the familiar school version of Euclid; a second which took it
 as a problem in calculus and trigonometry is not relevant here; the 
third, followed by Mitchel Resnick and Uri Wilensky used a version of 
Logo that allows many thousands of turtles. Wilensky describes their 
thinking as follows:

</p><p><font face="" size="-1">We imagined several rugby players 
standing in each patch along the perpendicular line, CK, with each 
player kicking thousands of balls in random directions. To find the best
 kicking point, we simply needed to determine which rugby player scored 
the most conversions. It was quite easy to write the StarLogo program 
that would implement this strategy.

</font></p><p><font face="" size="-1">The technology of StarLogo 
facilitated our seeing the problem as amenable to probabilistic methods.
 Indeed, the most important piece of mathematics that can be garnered 
from this example is not the numerical solution to the particular 
problem, but the transformation of the problem from one of calculus or 
geometry to one of discrete probability.</font>

</p><p>The fact that the Resnick/Wilensky process seemed surprising, as 
participants report that it did, says something significant (and not 
surprising) about the culture of school mathematics. I am sure that all 
the commentators and everyone present at the meeting were aware of the 
idea of Monte Carlo methods, but the comments indicate that this way of 
thinking is not salient enough, or does not feel natural enough, to leap
 out as a method to use. Hoyles and Noss in their book (1966) associate 
the choice of method with the software tools best known to the problem 
solver, so that one would expect Resnick and Wilensky to adopt this 
approach because of their relationship to StarLogo. But in fact the 
Monte Carlo solution does not need StarLogo and the use of StarLogo for 
this problem does not need Monte Carlo. A program in plain Logo takes a 
little longer but does as well, and I shall describe below a 
non-probabilistic approach to which StarLogo is no less well matched, 
and possibly even better matched, as the tool of choice. <i>This episode
 is not primarily about software tools. It is about the status of ideas 
on an empowerment/disempowerment dimension.</i> I see the whole episode 
as confirming my view of PT as having the status of a disempowered idea 
in the culture of mathematics education, and of <i>z</i> as making a 
needed contribution by restoring its power status.

</p><p>My personal approach to the problem when I first encountered it 
mobilized an idea that was as "hot" for me at the time as probabilistic 
methods might have been for Resnick and Wilensky. It took the form of a 
"heuristic drive" to break my thinking out of the line L and to 
visualize the subtended angle over the whole plane. My sense of 
connection was to potential fields and to questions about visualizing 
them by devices such as drawing equipotential contour lines or drawing a
 three-dimensional surface over a two-dimensional field.

</p><p>As it happened, giving the question, this orientation immediately
 merged into seeing the answer: the contour lines must be circles 
through A and B; the smaller circle represents the largest angle, so the
 answer is found by looking for the circle that just touches L. I would 
be happy if I could believe that students in <i>z</i> would go through 
this process just as I did (as well as recognizing the possibility of 
the Monte Carlo method). But asking what I really want them to learn 
leads me to split this process into two parts. The more important part 
is what led to the orientation, that is to say to activating the general
 field idea (including an awareness of the issue of visuali<i>z</i>ation).
 Knowing specifically that the equiangle lines happen to be circles is 
to me less important. So I tried to put myself in the position of a 
student who had taken the first but not the second of these steps.

</p><p>Now I should also like students who pose that question to think 
naturally of writing a program to visualize the fields. Their <i>z</i> 
experience would have highlighted both the general idea of looking for 
means to visualize situations and also the particular idea used here. In
 principle, StarLogo should be ideal for doing this as a program (which,
 incidentally, has no PT in it) to "tell" each point P (each "patch" in 
StarLogo language) to measure the angle APB and take on a color as a 
function of this angle. In practice, accidents about what has and has 
not been implemented in current versions of StarLogo made me feel that 
it would be simpler and more perspicuous to use MicroWorlds to write a 
Monte Carlo program using a probabilistic "dart throwing" metaphor. My 
Logo program instructed a turtle to place itself in a random position, 
randomly measure the angle subtended by AB at this position and take on a
 color as a function of the result.

<div align="center"><i>Figure 3</i></div>
<p>&nbsp;

</p><p>When I ran this procedure repeatedly the contour lines slowly 
emerged like a developing Polaroid photo. Only a few minutes were needed
 to recognize the emergence of circles; after ten minutes the graph was 
crisp and visually as well as conceptually pleasing.

</p><p>Now the third point I want to make might be the most fundamental.
 Looking over all the approaches to the problem mentioned here (or in 
the other commentaries), I see the contribution of the computer as split
 into two kinds.

</p><p>The Resnick/Wilensky solution is a pure case of the first of 
these: the computer allows the point to be found by actual measurement 
of the relevant quantity, namely the angle subtended at a point. The 
fact that ten thousand values can be measured in a way that feels to the
 user as simultaneous does not take away from the empirical nature of 
this  method. The same would be true for marching the turtle down L 
using the just-cited fragment of Logo code to measure the angle and 
embedding it in a not-very-complicated superprocedure to find the 
maximum. The method is quintessentially computational but leaves one 
with an answer that is mathematically unexplained and poorly connected 
to geometrically related situations.	
	
</p><p>A pure example of the second kind is using Cabri as a far more 
powerful instrument than ruler and compass or free-hand drawings, to 
build the constructions typically used in thinking about traditional 
school geometry. The computer is used to find an answer in a 
pre?computational conceptual space.

</p><p>In both cases the computer used as a tool effectively leads to a 
solution, but in neither does the computational representation make the 
mathematics more perspicuous.

</p><p>The approach to geometric thinking that I have called <i>z</i> 
combines key features of both kinds of contribution. The goal is to use 
computational thinking to forge ideas that are at least as "explicative"
 as the Euclid-like constructions (and hopefully more so) but more 
accessible and more powerful. In the next section I illustrate the idea 
by using Turtle geometry to give the theorem about angles subtended by a
 chord greater perspicuity, a more intuitive proof and new connections 
to other ideas.

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p></p><div align="center"><font face="" size="+1"><b>6. The Turtle 
Meets Euclid</b></font></div>

<p>I have always had a somewhat complex relationship with the subtended 
angle theorem. I have never been able to clear my mind completely of a 
feeling that there is something odd about that angle being the same as 
the point P moves along the circle. ("Surely down there in the corner 
between the circle and the chord the angle should be squished or 
something.") I would conjecture that such feelings could inhibit some 
people from thinking of this theorem and do the opposite for others. But
 in any case I feel that neither the standard Euclid-like proof nor 
playing with Cabri makes it transparently perspicuous that there should 
be a connection between the circleness of P's path and the constancy of 
the subtended angle.

</p><p>Looking at the situation in the perspective of Turtle geometry 
gives an insight into the connection and gives rise to a shorter proof 
(Papert,1986). Try seeing it in the following way:

</p><p><font face="" size="-1">In Turtle geometry the most basic images 
of the circle and of the subtended angle are quite close to one another.
 The primary way to think about the circle is a path of a turtle that 
turns as it moves forward. So the arc MPN is firmly associated with a 
certain amount of turn. Now think of the turtle trip that goes direct 
(in a straight line) from M to P, turns and then goes direct to N. Both 
set out from the same point, went through a motion involving turning and
 ended up at the same point. It seems natural to ask how the turnings in
 these two turtle trips are related. To do this, use a standard widely 
useful TURTLE GEOMETRY heuristic of having two turtles, T1 and T2, start
 in the same state (the same place and the same heading) and compare 
them as they do their trips.</font>

</p><p>So as Tl goes along the circle from M toward P, think of T2 going
 to P by first turning RIGHT a to align its heading with the line and 
then going straight to P without any further turning. Up to now how do 
the two turnings compare?

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><div align="center"><img alt="" 
src="AnExplorationintheSpaceofMathematicsEducations_files/figure4.jpg" 
border="0"></div>
<div align="center"><i>Figure 4</i></div>
<p>&nbsp;
</p><p>There are lots of ways to see that T1 turned exactly twice as 
much as T2. By symmetry you can see that the angle near P marked <i>a</i>
 is indeed the same as the angle near M. So you could say that T2 would 
have to do another RIGHT <i>a</i> to have the same heading as T1. So the
 turn in T1's trip was 2 x <i>a</i>. You can come to the same conclusion
 by noting that when Tl has traveled halfway to P it's heading is the 
same as T2's. In any case we conclude that <i>a</i> is half of the turn 
in the arc MM'P. Similarly, <i>b</i> must be half of the turn in the arc
 NN'P. So <i>a + b</i> is half of the turn in the whole arc MM'PN'N.

</p><p>In other words <i>a + b</i> is the same for every position of P

</p><p>Now we are getting there. We have an angle-related invariant! To 
pin down the angle <i>c</i>, look at the angles at P. Remembering that 
in TURTLE GEOMETRY we can talk about angles between lines and curves, we
 note that <i>a + b + c</i> is 180 degrees. So if <i>a + b</i> stays 
fixed, <i>c</i> must be as well.

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p><i>6a. The Turtle as Connection Agent</i>

</p><p>I see this way of looking at the subtended angle theorem as 
making a closer connection between the entities involved -- a circle and
 the vertex of a triangle. There are many other connections that flow 
from it. As a pointer to start the interested reader's mind going, 
consider the following propositions:

</p><p>Pl: The external angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the 
opposite internal angles.

<p>&nbsp;
</p><p>P2: The angle between a chord and a tangent is equal to the angle
 subtended in the opposite arc.

</p><p>Are they related? Look at P3:


</p><p>P3: Let AB be a straight line segment and ACC'B any curve that 
does not cross itself or AB. Then the 
	turn in ACC'B is equal to the sum of the angles <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> 
between the curve and AB.

</p><p>P1 is P3 with the triangle as C. P2 is P3 with the circular arc 
as C.

Conclusions: How Radical is <i>z</i>?</b></font></div>

<p>In the description of what I would put into <i>z</i> I have left to 
the end a discussion of which parts of SME I would leave out. In this 
conclusion I explore the question of whether something on the lines of <i>z</i>
 could satisfy the requirement mentioned in the opening section:

</p><p><font face="" size="-1">Could something be called "mathematics 
education" if it paid no attention to skill in numerical computation? Is
 it impossible to construct a mathematical education the set of topics 
of which is quite disjoint from school math and which would nonetheless 
serve all mathematically and socially defensible purposes claimed for 
learning mathematics? But how can we really know without investing time,
 effort and mathematical creativity into constructing counter-examples 
to the conservative (negative) answers?</font>

</p><p>Answering such questions might be far easier if somewhere there 
existed a consensus or even a prestigious body of discussion on the 
decision procedure for something to "serve all mathematically and 
socially defensible purposes claimed for learning mathematics." With the
 prospect of new opportunities for change it is becoming more important 
to find some way to deal with innovations that go beyond incremental 
changes that can be tested in the context of SME. However, not only is 
there no consensus on record; in fact I do not believe that such a 
definition of the goals of mathematics education is a meaningful 
concept. It is far too static in nature. As an alternative I propose a 
procedure in the form of a game called <i>Math Wars</i>.

</p><p>To enter the game a player proposes an ame. The other players 
then raise questions about how this ame achieves some purpose; the 
original player answers or modifies the entry and so the dialogue 
proceeds in a Lakatos-like fashion. This is vague, but if the game were 
to be taken seriously by a segment of the mathematics education 
community, roles about the format of the entries and rules of engagement
 for the discussion would soon emerge in a process that would be as 
valuable as playing the game. More important: I conjecture that the 
process would converge both on a set of ames and on a more refined 
culture of discussion of the purposes of mathematics education.

</p><p>SP: There is no evidence that the skills learned with such effort
 are actually used and even if they are, mechanical devices can be

</p><p>SP: The fact that X produces the admittedly good effect Y is only
 an argument in favor of X if it can be shown that X is a particularly 
good way to produce Y. And this requires considering alternatives to X, 
which the algebra word problem researchers do at best very timidly. In 
my view experience has shown that the algebra word problems of the

</p><p>Critic: But some excellent research is beginning to show how to 
get better results in teaching word problems.

</p><p>SP: I understand that this has become a challenge that the 
researchers in mathematics education do not want to abandon. But ego 
trips apart I believe that a better kind of research would be to find 
alternative mathematical activities rather than keep banging your head 
on these stone walls that are intrinsically poor anyway. Instead of 
making kids learn math let's make math kids will learn.

</p><p>Critic: What's poor about what you call SME activities?

</p><p>SP: They deal with boring problems rather than with personally 
engaging, long-term projects.

</p><p>Critic: Word problems may not be serious projects but they teach 
the elements of making a 
mathematical model, using variables and even understanding language.

</p><p>SP: Badly. And besides, Kafai's fourth graders did more and 
better mathematizing and much more problem-solving in making video games
 than all the word problems in all the algebra texts. And the extension 
of this activity in <i>z</i> based on ideas like object-based theories 
and greater access to better technology will make the disparity orders 
of magnitude greater.

</p><p>Critic: But wait a moment. Research has shown that students have 
trouble with reification, so they will have even greater difficulty with
 <i>z</i> than with algebra.

</p><p>SP: Your argument is an example of a typical vicious circle built
 into contemporary mathematics education research. If in fact students 
have trouble with reification this is because we have immersed them in 
an ame in which operations prime (and by a long shot) over objects. We 
mistake the results of our own training (successful for once in this 
case) for laws of psychology. The same is true of research that shows 
how bad people are at thinking probabilistically. School taught them to 
think in those ways (or at least reinforced any natural tendencies they 
had before going to school).

</p><p>Critic: Anyway, if you think you have some good stuff why not 
propose to include it in school math? Accentuate the positive! Why do 
you need to be negative about what's already there?

</p><p>SP: Two reasons. A superficial, but still very important, reason 
is time. Adding fragments students do not have the time to assimilate 
properly does more harm than good. The deeper reason is what Bateson 
calls deuterolearning: every time you learn something you learn two 
things, the other being the model of learning you just used. The stuff 
in SME carries with it a thoroughly bad model of mathematics and an even
 worse one of how to learn it. Admittedly the research community is 
doing a  heroic job of jiggering SME here and there. But what is wrong 
is not a cold but a cancer. It has to be extirpated.

</p><p>Critic (parting shot): Anyway your <i>z</i> is far less worked 
out than SME, which has been elaborated and polished by many generations
 of smart people. How can anything you make with the aid of a few 
friends be considered as a rival?

</p><p>SP: You have a point.

<p>For advice and patience in preparing this paper I am deeply in debt 
to Uri Leron and Richard Noss. I had very helpful comments from Mitchel 
Resnick, Carol Sperry, Brian Silverman and an anonymous referee. Since 
the ideas accumulated over a long time too many people contributed to 
them for me to mention, but I want to single out Andrea diSessa, Alan 
Kay and Richard Noss and Brian Silverman. During the recent time when I 
thought most about probability Uri Wilensky was so close to me that I 
find it hard to be sure which ideas on this topic were worked out with 
him or even simply borrowed from him.

<li>And is one in the more liberal sense used in computer science, that 
is, any procedure that 
outputs a (not necessarily unique) computational object.
<p>&nbsp;
</p></li><li>Logo specialists: Don't be put off by my modification to 
RANDOM to allow both lists and numbers as input. Traditionalists: Don't 
be put off by Logo's unorthodox functional notation. To connect with 
traditional function notation note that Logo will accept SETCOLOR 
(RANDOM ([blue green])) or even <i>g(f(x))</i> after definitions that 
make <i>f</i> equivalent to RANDOM and <i>g</i> to SETCOLOR. Both sides:
 these issues are relatively superficial anyway.
<p>&nbsp;
</p></li><li>This is Logo's way of saying, "Take an integer less than 
10,000 and append to it two zeros on the right."
<p>&nbsp;
</p></li><li>  The design of dynamic geometry programs is usually flawed
 in this respect, probably because of a deep-seated antagonism to 
anything that suggests programming as a mode of using the software. They
 consequently lost the chance to present the thing-like aspect of 
geometric operations performed by pull down, click and drag. Admittedly 
they enhance the thingness of the geometric objects, a good thing, even 
if this is probably the mathematical area where it is least needed.
<p>&nbsp;
</p></li><li>  Unpublished. I have a copy of the software, have worked 
with children with it and will describe it in my forthcoming book, <i>The
 Connected Family: Bridging the Digital Generation Gap.</i>
<p>&nbsp;
	 </p></li><li>  The multi-processing object-oriented nature of this 
manner of programming captures the idea of a superposition of two 
processes rather than of a single more contorted process. Thus it 
supports another powerful idea - superposition. It also supports a kind 
of reification to be discussed later.
<p>&nbsp;
</p></li><li>  Aaron Brandes, a doctoral candidate working under my 
supervision at MIT, has developed the idea that a group of children 
sometimes collectively generates intellectual steps characteristic of 
adult scientists that are not taken by individual children in the group.
 The group of children is more of a scientist than is the individual 
child.
<p>&nbsp;
	</p></li><li>  The choice between ready-made tools and programmable 
systems is a classical example of a "problem" that needs to be dissolved
 rather than solved. But for costs, laziness and prejudices we would 
have systems with both features. However it is to be noted that using a 
graphing tool for the graphs in Figure 1 would be silly: the graphing 
side of the Logo programming consisted of three lines of code and ten 
minutes of debugging and made something flexible enough for an even 
smaller programming effort to produce the forced perturbations which 
probably would have needed more ingenuity to obtain, if it could be done
 at all, with a ready-made graphing tool.
<p>&nbsp;
	</p></li><li>  Yasmin Kafai (1995) has extensively documented the 
feasibility of programming video-style games as an activity for 4<sup>th</sup>-
 and 5<sup>th</sup> -grade students under conditions far less favorable 
than those envisaged for <i>z</i>. In less formal studies I have worked 
with younger children with better software and a more supportive 
environment. Needless to say Kafai's findings are confirmed and 
exceeded.
<p>&nbsp;
</p></li><li>  During the refereeing process of this paper, I became 
aware of a tendency to misunderstand my intention. It was pointed out to
 me as problematic for the position I am arguing that there is a 
movement, perhaps most marked in the UK, to introduce experiences of 
motion in elementary school. But my point is not that school does not 
try to talk about motion but that there is no conceptual framework for 
dealing with it in a non-superficial way. Consider, for example, the 
parabolic path of a thrown stone. Checking through science texts I find 
that most make an authoritarian declaration that it is so. Some describe
 an experiment to find out. None give any insight into why it should be 
so. I don't blame them. The only way I know to do it requires a shift in
 the material conditions of school from primarily paper to primarily 
dynamic media and no less in the conceptual dimensions.
