    <p>
Dominic Randolph can seem a little out of place at <a href="http://www.riverdale.edu/default.aspx" target="_blank">Riverdale Country School</a>
 — which is odd, because he’s the headmaster. Riverdale is one of New 
York City’s most prestigious private schools, with a 104-year-old campus
 that looks down grandly on Van Cortlandt Park from the top of a steep 
hill in the richest part of the Bronx. On the discussion boards of <a href="http://www.urbanbaby.com/" target="_blank">UrbanBaby.com</a>,
 worked-up moms from the Upper East Side argue over whether Riverdale 
sends enough seniors to Harvard, Yale and Princeton to be considered 
truly “TT” (top-tier, in UrbanBabyese), or whether it is more accurately
 labeled “2T” (second-tier), but it is, certainly, part of the city’s 
private-school elite, a place members of the establishment send their 
kids to learn to be members of the establishment. Tuition starts at 
$38,500 a year, and that’s for prekindergarten.        </p>
<p>
Randolph, by contrast, comes across as an iconoclast, a disrupter, even a
 bit of an eccentric. He dresses for work every day in a black suit with
 a narrow tie, and the outfit, plus his cool demeanor and sweep of 
graying hair, makes you wonder, when you first meet him, if he might 
have played sax in a ska band in the ’80s. (The English accent helps.) 
He is a big thinker, always chasing new ideas, and a conversation with 
him can feel like a one-man TED conference, dotted with references to 
the latest work by behavioral psychologists and management gurus and 
design theorists. When he became headmaster in 2007, he swapped offices 
with his secretary, giving her the reclusive inner sanctum where 
previous headmasters sat and remodeling the small outer reception area 
into his own open-concept work space, its walls covered with whiteboard 
paint on which he sketches ideas and slogans. One day when I visited, 
one wall was bare except for a white sheet of paper. On it was printed a
 single black question mark.        </p>
<p>
For the headmaster of an intensely competitive school, Randolph, who is 
49, is surprisingly skeptical about many of the basic elements of a 
contemporary high-stakes American education. He did away with Advanced 
Placement classes in the high school soon after he arrived at Riverdale;
 he encourages his teachers to limit the homework they assign; and he 
says that the standardized tests that Riverdale and other private 
schools require for admission to kindergarten and to middle school are 
“a patently unfair system” because they evaluate students almost 
entirely by I.Q. “This push on tests,” he told me, “is missing out on 
some serious parts of what it means to be a successful human.”        </p>
<p>
The most critical missing piece, Randolph explained as we sat in his office last fall, is <em>character</em>
 — those essential traits of mind and habit that were drilled into him 
at boarding school in England and that also have deep roots in American 
history. “Whether it’s the pioneer in the Conestoga wagon or someone 
coming here in the 1920s from southern Italy, there was this idea in 
America that if you worked hard and you showed real grit, that you could
 be successful,” he said. “Strangely, we’ve now forgotten that. People 
who have an easy time of things, who get 800s on their SAT’s, I worry 
that those people get feedback that everything they’re doing is great. 
And I think as a result, we are actually setting them up for long-term 
failure. When that person suddenly has to face up to a difficult moment,
 then I think they’re screwed, to be honest. I don’t think they’ve grown
 the capacities to be able to handle that.”        </p>
<p>
Randolph has been pondering throughout his 23-year career as an educator
 the question of whether and how schools should impart good character. 
It has often felt like a lonely quest, but it has led him in some 
interesting directions. In the winter of 2005, Randolph read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-Mind/dp/0671019112" target="_blank">“Learned Optimism,”</a>
 a book by Martin Seligman, a psychology professor at the University of 
Pennsylvania who helped establish the Positive Psychology movement. 
Randolph found the book intriguing, and he arranged a meeting with the 
author. As it happened, on the morning that Randolph made the trip to 
Philadelphia, Seligman had scheduled a separate meeting with David 
Levin, the co-founder of the <a href="http://www.kipp.org/" target="_blank">KIPP network of charter schools</a>
 and the superintendent of the KIPP schools in New York City. Seligman 
decided he might as well combine the two meetings, and he invited 
Christopher Peterson, a psychology professor at the University of 
Michigan, who was also visiting Penn that day, to join him and Randolph 
and Levin in his office for a freewheeling discussion of psychology and 
schooling.        </p>
<p>
Levin had also spent many years trying to figure out how to provide 
lessons in character to his students, who were almost all black or 
Latino and from low-income families. At the first KIPP school, in 
Houston, he and his co-founder, Michael Feinberg, filled the walls with 
slogans like “Work Hard” and “Be Nice” and “There Are No Shortcuts,” and
 they developed a system of rewards and demerits designed to train their
 students not only in fractions and algebra but also in perseverance and
 empathy. Like Randolph, Levin went to Seligman’s office expecting to 
talk about optimism. But Seligman surprised them both by pulling out a 
new and very different book, which he and Peterson had just finished: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Character-Strengths-Virtues-Handbook-Classification/dp/0195167015" target="_blank">“Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification,”</a>
 a scholarly, 800-page tome that weighed in at three and a half pounds. 
It was intended, according to the authors, as a “manual of the 
sanities,” an attempt to inaugurate what they described as a “science of
 good character.”        </p>
<p>
It was, in other words, exactly what Randolph and Levin had been looking
 for, separately, even if neither of them had quite known it. Seligman 
and Peterson consulted works from Aristotle to Confucius, from the 
Upanishads to the Torah, from the Boy Scout Handbook to profiles of 
Pokémon characters, and they settled on 24 character strengths common to
 all cultures and eras. The list included some we think of as 
traditional noble traits, like bravery, citizenship, fairness, wisdom 
and integrity; others that veer into the emotional realm, like love, 
humor, zest and appreciation of beauty; and still others that are more 
concerned with day-to-day human interactions: social intelligence (the 
ability to recognize interpersonal dynamics and adapt quickly to 
different social situations), kindness, self-regulation, gratitude.     
   </p>
<p>
In most societies, Seligman and Peterson wrote, these strengths were 
considered to have a moral valence, and in many cases they overlapped 
with religious laws and strictures. But their true importance did not 
come from their relationship to any system of ethics or moral laws but 
from their practical benefit: cultivating these strengths represented a 
reliable path to “the good life,” a life that was not just happy but 
also meaningful and fulfilling.        </p>
<p>
Six years after that first meeting, Levin and Randolph are trying to put
 this conception of character into action in their schools. In the 
process, they have found themselves wrestling with questions that have 
long confounded not just educators but anyone trying to nurture a 
thriving child or simply live a good life. What is good character? Is it
 really something that can be taught in a formal way, in the classroom, 
or is it the responsibility of the family, something that is inculcated 
gradually over years of experience? Which qualities matter most for a 
child trying to negotiate his way to a successful and autonomous 
adulthood? And are the answers to those questions the same in Harlem and
 in Riverdale?        </p>
<p>
<strong>Levin had believed</strong> in the importance of character since
 KIPP’s inception. But on the day of his trip to see Seligman, he was 
feeling a new urgency about the subject. Six years earlier, in 1999, the
 first group of students to enter KIPP Academy middle school, which 
Levin founded and ran in the South Bronx, triumphed on the eighth-grade 
citywide achievement test, graduating with the highest scores in the 
Bronx and the fifth-highest in all of New York City. Every morning of 
middle school they passed a giant sign in the stairwell reminding them 
of their mission: “Climb the Mountain to College.” And as they left KIPP
 for high school, they seemed poised to do just that: not only did they 
have outstanding academic results, but most of them also won admission 
to highly selective private and Catholic schools, often with full 
scholarships.        </p>
<p>
But as Levin told me when we spoke last fall, for many students in that 
first cohort, things didn’t go as planned. “We thought, O.K., our first 
class was the fifth-highest-performing class in all of New York City,” 
Levin said. “We got 90 percent into private and parochial schools. It’s 
all going to be solved. But it wasn’t.” Almost every member of the 
cohort did make it through high school, and more than 80 percent of them
 enrolled in college. But then the mountain grew steeper, and every few 
weeks, it seemed, Levin got word of another student who decided to drop 
out. According to a report that KIPP issued last spring, only 33 percent
 of students who graduated from a KIPP middle school 10 or more years 
ago have graduated from a four-year college. That rate is considerably 
better than the 8 percent of children from low-income families who 
currently complete college nationwide, and it even beats the average 
national rate of college completion for all income groups, which is 31 
percent. But it still falls well short of KIPP’s stated goal: that 75 
percent of KIPP alumni will graduate from a four-year college, and 100 
percent will be prepared for a stable career.        </p>
<p>
As Levin watched the progress of those KIPP alumni, he noticed something
 curious: the students who persisted in college were not necessarily the
 ones who had excelled academically at KIPP; they were the ones with 
exceptional character strengths, like optimism and persistence and 
social intelligence. They were the ones who were able to recover from a 
bad grade and resolve to do better next time; to bounce back from a 
fight with their parents; to resist the urge to go out to the movies and
 stay home and study instead; to persuade professors to give them extra 
help after class. Those skills weren’t enough on their own to earn 
students a B.A., Levin knew. But for young people without the benefit of
 a lot of family resources, without the kind of safety net that their 
wealthier peers enjoyed, they seemed an indispensable part of making it 
to graduation day.        </p>
<p>
What appealed to Levin about the list of character strengths that 
Seligman and Peterson compiled was that it was presented not as a 
finger-wagging guilt trip about good values and appropriate behavior but
 as a recipe for a successful and happy life. He was wary of the idea 
that KIPP’s aim was to instill in its students “middle-class values,” as
 though well-off kids had some depth of character that low-income 
students lacked. “The thing that I think is great about the 
character-strength approach,” he told me, “is it is fundamentally devoid
 of value judgment.”        </p>
<p>
Still, neither Levin nor Dominic Randolph had a clear vision of how to 
turn an 800-page psychology text into a practical program. After that 
first meeting in Seligman’s office, Levin and Randolph kept in touch, 
calling and e-mailing, swapping articles and Web links, and they soon 
discovered that they shared a lot of ideas and interests, despite the 
very different school environments in which they worked. They decided to
 join forces, to try to tackle the mysteries of character together, and 
they turned for help to Angela Duckworth, who at the time was a graduate
 student in Seligman’s department (she is now an assistant professor). 
Duckworth came to Penn in 2002 at the age of 32, after working for a 
decade as a teacher and a charter-school consultant. When she applied to
 the Ph.D. program at Penn, she wrote in her application essay that her 
experiences in schools had given her “a distinctly different view of 
school reform” than the one she started out with in her 20s. “The 
problem, I think, is not only the schools but also the students 
themselves,” she wrote. “Here’s why: learning is hard. True, learning is
 fun, exhilarating and gratifying — but it is also often daunting, 
exhausting and sometimes discouraging. . . . To help chronically 
low-performing but intelligent students, educators and parents must 
first recognize that character is at least as important as intellect.”  
      </p>
<p>
Duckworth’s early research showed that measures of self-control can be a
 more reliable predictor of students’ grade-point averages than their 
I.Q.’s. But while self-control seemed to be a critical ingredient in 
attaining basic success, Duckworth came to feel it wasn’t as relevant 
when it came to outstanding achievement. People who accomplished great 
things, she noticed, often combined a passion for a single mission with 
an unswerving dedication to achieve that mission, whatever the obstacles
 and however long it might take. She decided she needed to name this 
quality, and she chose the word “grit.”        </p>
<p>
She developed a test to measure grit, which she called the Grit Scale. 
It is a deceptively simple test, in that it requires you to rate 
yourself on just 12 questions, from “I finish whatever I begin” to “I 
often set a goal but later choose to pursue a different one.” It takes 
about three minutes to complete, and it relies entirely on self-report —
 and yet when Duckworth took it out into the field, she found it was 
remarkably predictive of success. At Penn, high grit ratings allowed 
students with relatively low college-board scores to nonetheless achieve
 high G.P.A.’s. Duckworth and her collaborators gave their grit test to 
more than 1,200 freshman cadets as they entered West Point and embarked 
on the grueling summer training course known as Beast Barracks. The 
military has developed its own complex evaluation, called the Whole 
Candidate Score, to judge incoming cadets and predict which of them will
 survive the demands of West Point; it includes academic grades, a gauge
 of physical fitness and a Leadership Potential Score. But at the end of
 Beast Barracks, the more accurate predictor of which cadets persisted 
and which ones dropped out turned out to be Duckworth’s 12-item grit 
questionnaire.        </p>
<p>
Levin and Randolph asked Duckworth to use the new methods and tools she 
was developing to help them investigate the question of character at 
KIPP and Riverdale, and she and a handful of Penn graduate students 
began making regular treks from Philadelphia to New York. The first 
question Duckworth addressed, again, was the relative importance of I.Q.
 and self-control. She and her team of researchers gave middle-school 
students at Riverdale and KIPP a variety of psychological and I.Q. 
tests. They found that at both schools, I.Q. was the better predictor of
 scores on statewide achievement tests, but measures of self-control 
were more reliable indicators of report-card grades.        </p>
<p>
Duckworth’s research convinced Levin and Randolph that they should try 
to foster self-control and grit in their students. Yet those didn’t seem
 like the only character strengths that mattered. The full list of 24, 
on the other hand, felt too unwieldy. So they asked Peterson if he could
 narrow the list down to a more manageable handful, and he identified a 
set of strengths that were, according to his research, especially likely
 to predict life satisfaction and high achievement. After a few small 
adjustments (Levin and Randolph opted to drop love in favor of 
curiosity), they settled on a final list: zest, grit, self-control, 
social intelligence, gratitude, optimism and curiosity.        </p>
<p>
Over the course of the next year and a half, Duckworth worked with Levin
 and Randolph to turn the list of seven strengths into a two-page 
evaluation, a questionnaire that could be completed by teachers or 
parents, or by students themselves. For each strength, teachers 
suggested a variety of “indicators,” much like the questions Duckworth 
asked people to respond to on her grit questionnaire, and she 
road-tested several dozen of them at Riverdale and KIPP. She eventually 
settled on the 24 most statistically reliable ones, from “This student 
is eager to explore new things” (an indicator of curiosity) to “This 
student believes that effort will improve his or her future” (optimism).
        </p>
<p>
For Levin, the next step was clear. Wouldn’t it be cool, he mused, if 
each student graduated from school with not only a G.P.A. but also a 
C.P.A., for character-point average? If you were a college-admissions 
director or a corporate human-resources manager selecting entry-level 
employees, wouldn’t you like to know which ones scored highest in grit 
or optimism or zest? And if you were a parent of a KIPP student, 
wouldn’t you want to know how your son or daughter stacked up next to 
the rest of the class in character as well as in reading ability? As 
soon as he got the final list of indicators from Duckworth and Peterson,
 Levin started working to turn it into a specific, concise assessment 
that he could hand out to students and parents at KIPP’s New York City 
schools twice a year: the first-ever character report card.        </p>
<p>
<strong>Back at Riverdale,</strong> though, the idea of a character 
report card made Randolph nervous. “I have a philosophical issue with 
quantifying character,” he explained to me one afternoon. “With my 
school’s specific population, at least, as soon as you set up something 
like a report card, you’re going to have a bunch of people doing test 
prep for it. I don’t want to come up with a metric around character that
 could then be gamed. I would hate it if that’s where we ended up.”     
   </p>
<p>
Still, he did think that the inventory Duckworth and Peterson developed 
could be a useful tool in communicating with students about character. 
And so he has been taking what one Riverdale teacher described as a 
“viral approach” to spreading the idea of this new method of assessing 
character throughout the Riverdale community. He talks about character 
at parent nights, asks pointed questions in staff meetings, connects 
like-minded members of his faculty and instructs them to come up with 
new programs. Last winter, Riverdale students in the fifth and sixth 
grades took the 24-indicator survey, and their teachers rated them as 
well. The results were discussed by teachers and administrators, but 
they weren’t shared with students or parents, and they certainly weren’t
 labeled a “report card.”        </p>
<p>
As I spent time at Riverdale last year, it became apparent to me that 
the debate over character at the school wasn’t just about how best to 
evaluate and improve students’ character. It went deeper, to the 
question of what “character” really meant. When Randolph arrived at 
Riverdale, the school already had in place a character-education 
program, of a sort. Called <a href="http://www.riverdale.edu/podium/default.aspx?t=136009&amp;rc=0" target="_blank">CARE</a>,
 for Children Aware of Riverdale Ethics, the program was adopted in 1989
 in the lower school, which at Riverdale means prekindergarten through 
fifth grade. It is a blueprint for niceness, mandating that students 
“Treat everyone with respect” and “Be aware of other people’s feelings 
and find ways to help those whose feelings have been hurt.” Posters in 
the hallway remind students of the virtues related to CARE (“Practice 
Good Manners . . . Avoid Gossiping . . . Help Others”). In the lower 
school, many teachers describe it as a proud and essential part of what 
makes Riverdale the school that it is.        </p>
<p>
When I asked Randolph last winter about CARE, he was diplomatic. “I see 
the character strengths as CARE 2.0,” he explained. “I’d basically like 
to take all of this new character language and say that we’re in the 
next generation of CARE.”        </p>
<p>
In fact, though, the character-strength approach of Seligman and 
Peterson isn’t an expansion of programs like CARE; if anything, it is a 
repudiation of them. In 2008, a national organization called the 
Character Education Partnership published a paper that divided character
 education into two categories: programs that develop “moral character,”
 which embodies ethical values like fairness, generosity and integrity; 
and those that address “performance character,” which includes values 
like effort, diligence and perseverance. The CARE program falls firmly 
on the “moral character” side of the divide, while the seven strengths 
that Randolph and Levin have chosen for their schools lean much more 
heavily toward performance character: while they do have a moral 
component, strengths like zest, optimism, social intelligence and 
curiosity aren’t particularly heroic; they make you think of Steve Jobs 
or Bill Clinton more than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. or Gandhi.    
    </p>
<p>
The two teachers Randolph has chosen to oversee the school’s character 
initiative are K.C. Cohen, the guidance counselor for the middle and 
upper schools, and Karen Fierst, a learning specialist in the lower 
school. Cohen is friendly and thoughtful, in her mid-30s, a graduate of 
Fieldston, the private school just down the road from Riverdale. She is 
intensely interested in character development, and like Randolph, she is
 worried about the character of Riverdale students. But she is not yet 
entirely convinced by the seven character strengths that Riverdale has 
ostensibly chosen. “When I think of good character, I think: Are you 
fair? Are you honest in dealings with other people? Are you a cheater?” 
she told me. “I don’t think so much about: Are you tenacious? Are you a 
hard worker? I think, Are you a good person?”        </p>
<p>
Cohen’s vision of character is much closer to “moral character” than 
“performance character,” and so far, that vision remains the dominant 
one at Riverdale. When I spent a day at the school in March, sitting in 
on a variety of classes and meetings, messages about behavior and values
 permeated the day, but those messages stayed almost entirely in the 
moral dimension. It was a hectic day at the middle school — it was 
pajama day, plus there was a morning assembly, and then on top of that, 
the kids in French class who were going on the two-week trip to Bordeaux
 for spring break had to leave early in order to make their overnight 
flight to Paris. The topic for the assembly was heroes, and a half-dozen
 students stood up in front of their classmates — about 350 kids, in all
 — and each made a brief presentation about a particular hero he or she 
had chosen: Ruby Nell Bridges, the African-American girl who was part of
 the first group to integrate the schools in New Orleans in 1960; 
Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian fruit vendor whose self-immolation helped
 spark the recent revolt in that country; the actor and activist Paul 
Robeson.        </p>
<p>
In the assembly, in classes and in conversations with different 
students, I heard a lot of talk about values and ethics, and the values 
that were emphasized tended to be social values: inclusion, tolerance, 
diversity. (I heard a lot more about black history at Riverdale than I 
did at the KIPP schools I visited.) One eighth-grade girl I asked about 
character said that for her and her friends, the biggest issue was 
inclusion — who was invited to whose bat mitzvah; who was being shunned 
on Facebook. Character, as far as I could tell, was being defined at 
Riverdale mostly in terms of helping other people — or at least not 
hurting their feelings.        </p>
<p>
Randolph told me that he had concerns about a character program that 
comprised only those kind of nice-guy values. “The danger with character
 is if you just revert to these general terms — respect, honesty, 
tolerance — it seems really vague,” he said. “If I stand in front of the
 kids and just say, ‘It’s really important for you to respect each 
other,’ I think they glaze over. But if you say, ‘Well, actually you 
need to exhibit self-control,’ or you explain the value of social 
intelligence — this will help you collaborate more effectively — then it
 seems a bit more tangible.”        </p>
<p>
When I spoke to Karen Fierst, the teacher who was overseeing the 
character project for the Riverdale lower school, she said she was 
worried that it would be a challenge to convince the students and their 
parents that there was anything in the 24 character strengths that might
 actually benefit them. For KIPP kids, she said, the notion that 
character could help them get through college was a powerful lure, one 
that would motivate them to take the strengths seriously. For kids at 
Riverdale, though, there was little doubt that they would graduate from 
college. “It will just happen,” Fierst explained. “It happened to every 
generation in their family before them. And so it’s harder to get them 
to invest in this idea. For KIPP students, learning these strengths is 
partly about trying to demystify what makes other people successful — 
kind of like, ‘We’re letting you in on the secret of what successful 
people are like.’ But kids here already live in a successful community. 
They’re not depending on their teachers to give them the information on 
how to be successful.”        </p>
<p>
<strong>At KIPP Infinity middle school,</strong> which occupies one 
floor of a school on West 133rd Street, across from the M.T.A.’s giant 
Manhattanville bus depot, report-card night last winter fell on a cold 
Thursday at the beginning of February. Report-card night is always a big
 deal at KIPP schools — parents are strongly urged to attend, and at 
Infinity, almost all of them do — but this particular evening carried an
 extra level of anxiety for both the administrators and the parents, 
because students were receiving their very first character report cards,
 and no one knew quite what to expect.        </p>
<p>
Logistically, the character report card had been a challenge to pull 
off. Teachers at all four KIPP middle schools in New York City had to 
grade every one of their students, on a scale of 1 to 5, on every one of
 the 24 character indicators, and more than a few of them found the 
process a little daunting. And now that report-card night had arrived, 
they had an even bigger challenge: explaining to parents just how those 
precise figures, rounded to the second decimal place, summed up their 
children’s character. I sat for a while with Mike Witter, a 31-year-old 
eighth-grade English teacher, as he talked through the character report 
card with Faith Flemister and her son Juaquin Bennett, a tall, hefty 
eighth grader in a gray hooded sweatshirt.        </p>
<p>
“For the past few years we’ve been working on a project to create a 
clearer picture for parents about the character of your child,” Witter 
explained to Flemister. “The categories that we ended up putting 
together represent qualities that have been studied and determined to be
 indicators of success. They mean you’re more likely to go to college. 
More likely to find a good job. Even surprising things, like they mean 
you’re more likely to get married, or more likely to have a family. So 
we think these are really important.”        </p>
<p>
Flemister nodded, and Witter began to work his way down the scores on 
Juaquin’s character report card, starting with the good news: every 
teacher had scored him as a perfect 5 on “Is polite to adults and 
peers,” and he did almost as well on “Keeps temper in check.” They were 
both indicators for interpersonal self-control.        </p>
<p>
“I can tell this is a real strength for you,” Witter said, turning to 
Juaquin. “This kind of self-control is something you’ve developed 
incredibly well. So that makes me think we need to start looking at: 
What’s something we can target? And the first thing that jumps out at me
 is this.” Witter pulled out a green felt-tip marker and circled one 
indicator on Juaquin’s report card. “ ‘Pays attention and resists 
distraction,’ ” Witter read aloud, an indicator for academic 
self-control. “That’s a little lower than some of the other numbers. Why
 do you think that is?”        </p>
<p>
“I talk too much in class,” Juaquin said, a little sheepishly, looking 
down at his black sneakers. “I sometimes stare off into space and don’t 
pay attention.”        </p>
<p>
The three of them talked over a few strategies to help Juaquin focus 
more in class, and by the end of the 15-minute conversation, Flemister 
seemed convinced by the new approach. “The strong points are not a 
surprise,” she said to Witter as he got up to talk to another family. 
“That’s just the type of person Juaquin is. But it’s good how you 
pinpoint what he can do to make things easier on himself. Then maybe his
 grades will pick up.”        </p>
<p>
A month later, I returned to KIPP to visit Witter’s classroom. By that 
point in the school year, character language had permeated Infinity. 
Kids wore T-shirts with the slogan “Infinite Character” and Seligman’s 
24 character strengths listed on the back. The walls were covered with 
signs that read “Got self-control?” and “I actively participate!” (one 
indicator for zest). There was a bulletin board in the hallway topped 
with the words “Character Counts,” where students filled out and posted 
“Spotted!” cards when they saw a fellow student performing actions that 
demonstrate character. (Jasmine R. cited William N. for zest: “William 
was in math class and he raised his hand for every problem.”)        </p>
<p>
I came to Witter’s class to observe something that Levin was calling 
“dual-purpose instruction,” the practice of deliberately working 
explicit talk about character strengths into every lesson. Levin wanted 
math teachers to use the strengths in word problems; he explained that 
history teachers could use them to orient a class discussion about 
Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. And when I arrived in 
Witter’s class at 7:45 on a Thursday morning in March, he was leading a 
discussion about Chinua Achebe’s novel “Things Fall Apart.” Above 
Witter’s head, at the front of the class, the seven character strengths 
were stenciled in four-inch-high letters, white on blue, from optimism 
to social intelligence. He asked his students to rank Okonkwo, the 
protagonist, on his various character strengths. There was a lot of back
 and forth, but in the end, most students agreed that Okonkwo rated 
highest on grit and lowest on self-control. Then a student named Yantzee
 raised his hand. “Can’t a trait backfire at you?” he asked.        </p>
<p>
“Sure, a trait can backfire,” Witter said. “Too much grit, like Okonkwo,
 you start to lose your ability to have empathy for other people. If 
you’re so gritty that you don’t understand why everyone’s complaining 
about how hard things are, because nothing’s hard for you, because 
you’re Mr. Grit, then you’re going to have a hard time being kind. Even 
love — being too loving might make you the kind of person who can get 
played.” There was a ripple of knowing laughter from the students. “So, 
yes, character is something you have to be careful about. Character 
strengths can become character weaknesses.”        </p>
<p>
Though the seven character strengths aren’t included in every lesson at 
KIPP, they do make it into most conversations about discipline. One day 
last winter, I was speaking with Sayuri Stabrowski, a 30-year-old 
seventh-and-eighth-grade reading teacher at KIPP Infinity, and she 
mentioned that she caught a girl chewing gum in her class earlier that 
day. “She denied it,” Stabrowski told me. “She said, ‘No, I’m not, I’m 
chewing my tongue.’ ” Stabrowski rolled her eyes as she told me the 
story. “I said, ‘O.K. fine.’ Then later in the class, I saw her chewing 
again, and I said: ‘You’re chewing gum! I see you.’ She said, ‘No, I’m 
not, see?’ and she moved the gum over in her mouth in this really 
obvious way, and we all saw what she was doing. Now, a couple of years 
ago, I probably would have blown my top and screamed. But this time, I 
was able to say: ‘Gosh, not only were you chewing gum, which is kind of 
minor, but you lied to me twice. That’s a real disappointment. What does
 that say about your character?’ And she was just devastated.”        </p>
<p>
Stabrowski was worried that the girl, who often struggled with her 
behavior, might have a mini-meltdown — a “baby attack,” in KIPP jargon —
 in the middle of the class, but in fact, the girl spit out her gum and 
sat through the rest of the class and then afterward came up to her 
teacher with tears in her eyes. “We had a long conversation,” Stabrowski
 told me. “She said: ‘I’m trying so hard to just grow up. But nothing 
ever changes!’ And I said: ‘Do you know what does change? You didn’t 
have a baby attack in front of the other kids, and two weeks ago, you 
would have.’ ”        </p>
<p>
To Tom Brunzell, who as the dean of students at KIPP Infinity oversaw 
the implementation of the character report card, what is going on in 
character conversations like that one isn’t academic instruction at all,
 or even discipline; it’s therapy. Specifically, it’s a kind of 
cognitive behavioral therapy, the very practical, nuts-and-bolts 
psychological technique that provides the theoretical underpinning for 
the whole positive psychology field. Cognitive behavioral therapy, or 
C.B.T., involves using the conscious mind to understand and overcome 
unconscious fears and self-destructive habits, using techniques like 
“self-talk” — putting an immediate crisis in perspective by reminding 
yourself of the larger context. “The kids who succeed at KIPP are the 
ones who can C.B.T. themselves in the moment,” Brunzell told me. Part of
 the point of the character initiative, as he saw it, was to give their 
students the tools to do that. “All kids this age are having 
mini-implosions every day,” he said. “I mean, it’s middle school, the 
worst years of their lives. But the kids who make it are the ones who 
can tell themselves: ‘I can rise above this little situation. I’m O.K. 
Tomorrow is a new day.’ ”        </p>
<p>
<strong>For Randolph,</strong> the experience that Brunzell was 
describing — the struggle to pull yourself through a crisis, to come to 
terms on a deep level with your own shortcomings and to labor to 
overcome them — is exactly what is missing for so many students at 
academically excellent schools like Riverdale. And perhaps surprisingly,
 it may turn out to be an area where the students at KIPP have a real 
advantage over Riverdale kids. On the professional development day in 
February when I visited Riverdale, Randolph had arranged a screening for
 his entire faculty of “Race to Nowhere,” a movie about the stresses 
facing mostly privileged American high-school students that has become 
an underground hit in many wealthy suburbs, where one-time showings at 
schools, churches and community centers bring out hundreds of concerned 
parents. The movie paints a grim portrait of contemporary adolescence, 
rising in an emotional crescendo to the story of an overachieving 
teenage girl who committed suicide, apparently because of the 
ever-increasing pressure to succeed that she felt both at school and at 
home. At Riverdale, the film seemed to have a powerful effect on many of
 the staff; one teacher who came up to Randolph afterward had tears in 
her eyes.        </p>
<p>
“Race to Nowhere” has helped to coalesce a growing movement of 
psychologists and educators who argue that the systems and methods now 
in place to raise and educate well-off kids in the United States are in 
fact devastating them. One central figure in the movie is Madeline 
Levine, a psychologist in Marin County who is the author of a 
best-selling book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Price-Privilege-Advantage-Generation-Disconnected/dp/0060595841" target="_blank">“The
 Price of Privilege: How Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are 
Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids.”</a> In her 
book, Levine cites studies and surveys to back up her contention that 
children of affluent parents now exhibit “unexpectedly high rates of 
emotional problems beginning in junior high school.” This is no accident
 of demographics, Levine says, but instead is a direct result of the 
child-raising practices that prevail in well-off American homes; wealthy
 parents today, she argues, are more likely to be emotionally distant 
from their children, and at the same time to insist on high levels of 
achievement, a potentially toxic blend of influences that can create 
“intense feelings of shame and hopelessness” in affluent children.      
  </p>
<p>
Cohen and Fierst told me that they also see many Riverdale parents who, 
while pushing their children to excel, also inadvertently shield them 
from exactly the kind of experience that can lead to character growth. 
As Fierst put it: “Our kids don’t put up with a lot of suffering. They 
don’t have a threshold for it. They’re protected against it quite a bit.
 And when they do get uncomfortable, we hear from their parents. We try 
to talk to parents about having to sort of make it O.K. for there to be 
challenge, because that’s where learning happens.”        </p>
<p>
Cohen said that in the middle school, “if a kid is a C student, and 
their parents think that they’re all-A’s, we do get a lot of pushback: 
‘What are you talking about? This is a great paper!’ We have parents 
calling in and saying, for their kids, ‘Can’t you just give them two 
more days on this paper?’ Overindulging kids, with the intention of 
giving them everything and being loving, but at the expense of their 
character — that’s huge in our population. I think that’s one of the 
biggest problems we have at Riverdale.”        </p>
<p>
This is a problem, of course, for all parents, not just affluent ones. 
It is a central paradox of contemporary parenting, in fact: we have an 
acute, almost biological impulse to provide for our children, to give 
them everything they want and need, to protect them from dangers and 
discomforts both large and small. And yet we all know — on some level, 
at least — that what kids need more than anything is a little hardship: 
some challenge, some deprivation that they can overcome, even if just to
 prove to themselves that they can. As a parent, you struggle with these
 thorny questions every day, and if you make the right call even half 
the time, you’re lucky. But it’s one thing to acknowledge this dilemma 
in the privacy of your own home; it’s quite another to have it addressed
 in public, at a school where you send your kids at great expense.      
  </p>
<p>
And it’s that problem that Randolph is up against as he tries to push 
forward this new kind of conversation about character at Riverdale. When
 you work at a public school, whether it’s a charter or a traditional 
public school, you’re paid by the state, responsible, on some level, to 
your fellow citizens for the job you do preparing your students to join 
the adult world. When you work at a private school like Riverdale, 
though, even one with a long waiting list, you are always conscious that
 you’re working for the parents who pay the tuition fees. Which makes a 
campaign like the one that Randolph is trying to embark on all the more 
complicated. If your premise is that your students are lacking in deep 
traits like grit and gratitude and self-control, you’re implicitly 
criticizing the parenting they’ve received — which means you’re 
implicitly criticizing your employers.        </p>
<p>
When I asked Randolph to explain just what he thought Riverdale students
 were missing out on, he told me the story of his own scholastic career.
 He did well in boarding school and was admitted to Harvard, but when he
 got to college, he felt lost, out of step with the power-tie careerism 
of the Reagan ’80s. After two years at Harvard, Randolph left for a year
 to work in a low-paying manual job, as a carpenter’s helper, trying to 
find himself. After college, he moved for a couple of years to Italy, 
where he worked odd jobs and studied opera. It was an uncertain and 
unsettled time in his life, filled with plenty of failed experiments and
 setbacks and struggles. Looking back on his life, though, Randolph says
 that the character strengths that enabled him to achieve the success 
that he has were not built in his years at Harvard or at the boarding 
schools he attended; they came out of those years of trial and error, of
 taking chances and living without a safety net. And it is precisely 
those kinds of experiences that he worries that his students aren’t 
having.        </p>
<p>
“The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get 
that through failure,” Randolph explained. “And in most highly academic 
environments in the United States, no one fails anything.”        </p>
<p>
Most Riverdale students can see before them a clear path to a certain 
type of success. They’ll go to college, they’ll graduate, they’ll get 
well-paying jobs — and if they fall along the way, their families will 
almost certainly catch them, often well into their 20s or even 30s, if 
necessary. But despite their many advantages, Randolph isn’t yet 
convinced that the education they currently receive at Riverdale, or the
 support they receive at home, will provide them with the skills to 
negotiate the path toward the deeper success that Seligman and Peterson 
hold up as the ultimate product of good character: a happy, meaningful, 
productive life. Randolph wants his students to succeed, of course — 
it’s just that he believes that in order to do so, they first need to 
learn how to fail.        </p>
