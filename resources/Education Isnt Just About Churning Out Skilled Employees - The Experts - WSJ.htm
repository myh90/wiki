<p><em>Companies often complain they aren’t getting graduates with the skills they need. Why is that—and what should be done about it?</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>GIANPIERO PETRIGLIERI: </strong>There is so much revealing ambiguity in the question <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal </em>posed to us leadership Experts today (see above) that it is worth pondering it for a moment.</p>
<p>It is not quite clear what “why is that” refers to. Why do companies 
often (and publicly) complain that they can’t get skillful graduates? Or
 why can’t they get them? And who is the second “they”? Are graduates 
lacking the skills that companies need? Or are they lacking the skills 
they need themselves?<br>
I’m not being picky. I’m being provocative. I suspect most casual 
readers, like me at first, will go through such a question without 
picking up any ambiguity at all.</p>
<p>The reason is that we have become accustomed to assuming that 
corporate recruiters are the best judges of the outcomes of education, 
and that what individuals need from education is acquiring the skills to
 make them useful and efficient in corporate jobs.</p>
<p>That is a problem.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that one of the main functions of education
 is to support the economy by churning out skillful employees. That is 
not, however, its only function. The others are supporting the culture 
it is embedded in by churning out responsible citizens—who are not all, 
only, or always going to hold corporate jobs—and supporting individual 
students by liberating their imagination and accelerating their 
development.</p>
<p>In short, a good education—especially the kind required to develop 
leaders—encompasses training, socialization and emancipation. To reduce 
it to training in the skills that companies need is to subordinate 
education—to ask it to put aside the effort to raise leaders for the 
future and focus on making better followers for the present.</p>
<p>There is more value, in my opinion, in restoring and celebrating the 
ambiguity. That will allow us to consider not only if the skills 
corporations and individuals need, and those education equips graduates 
with, overlap enough—but also what discrepancies may be necessary to 
help our companies, communities and ourselves thrive.</p>
